DIABETES REVERSAL
Have you ever thought of diabetes as a life sentence? Has the thought of every meal filled you with dread? If you’ve been diagnosed recently or have been living with diabetes for years, or even decades, take heart – there is hope. We’re here to help you regain control of your life.

Diabetes mellitus, a lifestyle disease, impacts your body’s ability to effectively use the energy derived from food. With multiple meals a day, managing insulin shots or diabetes pills can become a source of constant stress. But diabetes does not have to be your constant companion. Groundbreaking clinical studies, including those by Dr. Neal D. Barnard, have shown that diabetes is reversible. These studies have shed light on how we can either reverse diabetes or dramatically cut down on medication by aiding the body in improving its insulin usage.

Our program, resting on the three pillars of diet, exercise & meditation. , delves into the root causes of diabetes. The goal is not just to treat the symptoms but to address the origin of the condition. Research conducted over decades on individuals from various ethnic backgrounds worldwide has informed our approach. Programs like ours have already helped thousands of individuals manage and potentially reverse their diabetes condition globally.

The Program
The program, based on Dr. Barnard’s research, has successfully demonstrated that a new dietary approach can prevent, control, and even reverse diabetes. Dr. Joel Fuhrman has also shown that preventing, improving or even reversing type 2 diabetes is entirely possible. Dr. Gabriel Cousens has used spiritual healing in his holistic medical practice. These researchers, doctors and many others, together have proven over and over again that diet, exercise, and meditation have been shown to aid in the management and potential reversal of diabetes. Dr. Pramod Tripathi has taken these learnings and helped thousands of diabetic patients in India as well. He has helped 1000+ patients get off of insulin, and 5000+ patients get off of tablets.

Diabetes is a condition influenced by daily habits. To tackle any disease, you have to attack the root cause of it, and with diabetes being a lifestyle disease it is imperative that we attack it with basic tenants of life – proper diet, appropriate exercise, and mindful meditation.

Diabetes Free Life is a non-profit organization formed with the sole purpose of promoting awareness on how to reverse diabetes. We aim to provide easy to follow and practical guidance to as many diabetic patients as possible. The three-stage program is based on a series of research by Dr. Barnard, Dr. Fuhrman, Dr. Cousens, and advice from Dr. Tripathi.
Participants of this program may see significant improvement in their blood sugar management and general health by losing weight and lowering blood pressure and cholesterol.

Diabetes Symptoms
What are the symptoms of Type 2 Diabetes?
Check Prevention
01.
Urinate
Frequent urination, especially at night, and increased thirst are common symptoms of diabetes. This happens because the high glucose levels in your blood force your kidneys to work harder to remove the excess sugar, resulting in increased urine production. If you’re experiencing these symptoms, it’s crucial to get checked for diabetes.

Know Your Diet
02.
Fatigue
Consistent feelings of fatigue and weakness could be signs of diabetes. When your body can’t effectively use glucose for energy, you may feel constantly tired, regardless of how much rest you get. Don’t ignore persistent fatigue; it could be your body signaling a problem with blood sugar levels.

Know Your Diet
03.
Unexpected weight loss
Unexpected weight loss, despite having an increased appetite, can be a sign of diabetes. When your body can’t properly use glucose for energy, it starts breaking down stored fat and muscle for fuel, leading to weight loss. If you’re losing weight without trying, it’s important to consider diabetes as a possible cause.

Know Your Diet
04.
Blurred vision
Blurred vision can be a symptom of diabetes, caused by high blood sugar levels damaging the blood vessels in your eyes. If you’re experiencing blurred vision, it’s crucial to seek medical advice as it could indicate uncontrolled diabetes.

Know Your Diet
05.
Slow Wound Healing
Slow wound healing can be a sign of diabetes. High blood sugar levels can affect blood flow and slow down the production of collagen, an essential protein for wound healing. If you’ve noticed that cuts and bruises take longer to heal, it might be time to check your blood sugar levels.

Know Your Diet
06.
Numbness or tingling in the hands or feet
Numbness or tingling in your hands or feet can be a symptom of diabetes, often due to nerve damage caused by high blood sugar levels. This symptom should not be ignored, as it can lead to more serious complications if diabetes is left uncontrolled.


DIET
The diet of a diabetic patient does not need to be restrictive. The diet should instead be healthy, rich in nutrients, low in fat, low in calories, and alkaline in nature. A diet that facilitates diabetes reversal is the best eating plan for anyone.
In the modern diet, many items are taking a toll on health. To name a few…

Refined sugar: It has been proven over several studies that refined sugar causes insulin resistance and fatty liver. It has also been proven to have close links to obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. So whether you have diabetes or not, if you want a healthy life, you should avoid refined sugar.

Refined grains: Some studies similar to the one by Dr. Barnard have proven that refined grain leads to rapid spikes in blood sugar, insulin resistance, and weight gain. It would be best if you avoided having refined grains as the first meal of your day.

Refined Oils: Refined oils are considered high in inflammatory Omega-6 fatty acids; these oils increase inflammation and oxidative damage. A healthy body decreases inflammation and reduces oxidative damage by avoiding refined oils.

Trans Fats: The last but not least on the list is trans fat. Trans fat is extremely harmful; artificial fats are found in processed foods and are linked to many serious diseases, especially heart disease. Trans fat also contributes to diabetes. By eliminating processed food and trans fat in your body, you will achieve better insulin sensitivity.

A low-fat plant-based diet, also known as Vegan Diet, profoundly impacts metabolic conditions like Diabetes. Clinical researchers like Barnard, associate professor of medicine at the George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences, and Dr. Joel Fuhrman, Director of Research at the Nutritional Research Foundation, have studied vegan diet for decades. And based on the studies they’ve conducted over the past few decades, there is conclusive proof that a vegan diet is three times more effective in controlling our blood sugar than other diets usually recommended for people with diabetes by doctors.

For those new to the vegan diet, it is a vegetarian diet that excludes animal products like meat, eggs, dairy, and other animal-derived ingredients. To understand why a vegan diet is so crucial in reversing diabetes, we first need to understand the cause of diabetes and what effect animal products have on our bodies.

We all know diabetes is a type of malfunction when our body cannot use the sugar formed due to digestion. Our blood sugar levels are dependent on the production of the hormone insulin from the pancreas. People who have type 2 diabetes are insulin resistant. Insulin helps in transporting glucose. The hormone binds to a receptor on the cell wall, opening a passage that allows glucose to enter the cell. The cell then metabolizes this glucose to use it as fuel to perform its various tasks.

Dietary causes of diabetes are :

(1) Fat interfering with hormones,
(2) Acidic and inflamed system and
(3) Lack of micronutrients [vitamins, minerals, phytonutrients, antioxidants, nutraceuticals, etc.].
If you can fix your diet to remove these three irritants, you will see significant improvement in your blood sugar levels. Based on clinical studies by Dr. Neal Barnard, by adopting a low-fat vegetarian diet free of all animal products and added vegetable oils, individuals can lower their cholesterol, reduce their blood pressure, lose weight and attain better control over blood sugar. The reason is simple. A low-fat vegetarian diet (vegan diet without added vegetable oils) reduces the fat interfering with your hormones which will allow insulin that you naturally produce to bind correctly to the cell wall opening passage to allow for glucose to enter the cell. A vegan diet is also naturally abundant in vitamins, minerals, and phytonutrients. Now, if you focus on specific vegetables, you can also reduce the acidity in your body, reducing the inflammation in your system while providing antioxidants and nutraceuticals.
We typically start the day with a cup of tea or coffee in the morning. Usually, that is the first thing we consume on an empty stomach. Unfortunately, everyone, including healthy individuals, builds up acidity overnight. Both tea and coffee are acidic, so we increase our acidity by consuming tea or coffee first thing in the morning. Instead, the first thing you should do to start your day is to reduce the acidity buildup overnight with a nutrient-dense green smoothie that will help alkalize your body.
